Each file is a compressed archive file that contains the source code
and data files for each of the various parts of the book "Photorealism
and Ray Tracing in C", by Christopher Watkins, Stephen B. Coy and Mark
Finlay (M&T Publishing, 1992).


INSTALLATION

The INSTALL.BAT batch file will transfer programs and data files
from the diskette drive to your hard disk. The total disk space
requirements are about 12 megabytes.  If you do not have this space on
your hard drive, you can conduct the installation process a
a step at a time, by typing in the DOS commands yourself (explained
further below).

As written, the batch file desires you to enter the names
of your floppy and hard drives.  Your floppy drive is assumed
to be first (A:), your hard drive the second (C:).  The batch
file also will place files in subdirectories that branch from a
directory named BOB which is off the root directory on your hard
drive.  If this is not what you prefer, you can edit the batch
file appropriately with an ASCII text editor.

Before you use these diskettes, it is a good idea to make a backup copy
of them using the DISKCOPY utility in your DOS directory.  As always,
save the original diskettes in a safe place in case your copies become
lost or damaged.

To run the installation program, type:

                 A:

to switch to the A: floppy drive and

                 INSTALL A: C:

to install the software on floppy drive A: to hard drive C:.

When you have installed Disk 1, then repeat the process
for Disk 2:

                 INSTALL2 A: C:


MANUAL INSTALLATION

To install the files one section at a time, here are the instructions.
These instructions assume your hard drive is C: and your floppy drive is
A: (if this is not the case, you should make the appropriate changes).

1. First, log onto the root directory of your hard drive by typing 
               C:
               CD \

2. Then make a directory on that drive, by typing 
               MD SAMPLE

3. Then decompress the files from the floppy drive (for example,
   the sample files), by typing

               A:PKUNZIP A:SAMPLE C:\SAMPLE


A GENERAL NOTE ABOUT ROBUSTNESS

The source code files in this diskette are for illustration purposes
only.  As such, there is very little "bulletproofing" of the kind
found in commercial programs.  For example, many programs do not
check if a particular data file is present before trying to open it.
As a consequence you will get a runtime error if you mistype a
filename.  

Also, in the case of abnormal program exit such as this, the VGA
display state may be left in a different mode from the one at time of
program start.  You may need to reboot the machine to restore the
original VGA mode (or you can use the MODE BW80 command in DOS to
restore 80-column mode).  We suggest rebooting, as memory problems
may result from an unexpected exit.

If you encounter runtime errors, you can try to determine the cause
by using the powerful Turbo Debugger that is bundled with some Borland
language products (and also available separately) or the debugging tools
found with the Watcom compiler.


COMPILING PROGRAMS

All programs in the book have their executable files on the diskettes.  This
is because some people will have the Watcom compiler, and some people will
have the Borland compiler, and there might be problems compiling and running
certain programs on certain compilers based on your system configuration.
All of the software in this book was written in C using Borland C++ version
3.1 and WATCOM C version 9.0.  The Borland C++ software was furnished by
Borland International, 1800 Green Hills Road, Scotts Valley, CA 95066.
The WATCOM C software was furnished by WATCOM, 415 Phillip Street, Ontario,
Canada, N2L 3X2.

The executables included on the diskettes are:

C:\BOB\SAMPLE

  CRYSTAL
  PLANTS
  STARS-3D
  3D-3PORB

C:\BOB\PROC

  TREES
  TORUS
  TILEPUZL
  SPHRFLAK
  SPONGE
  HEXER

C:\BOB\PROCZBUF

  PLOTEQN
  OCEAN
  CPM-MSET
  CPM-JSET
  QUATER
  QUATER2
  TERRAIN
  SMOOTH

C:\BOB\MODELER

  ED

C:\BOB\RT

  BOB

C:\BOB\TOOLS

  GIF2IMG
  IMG2GIF
  IMG2TGA
  TGA2IMG
  GIFVIEW
  VIEW
  FILTER

These are the major programs discussed in the book.  Also on the
diskettes are many example data files with which you can use with
the programs.  Consult the discussions in the book for how these
programs work and what particular data files they require.

All the source code files for the Borland compiler in the diskette come
with .DSK and .PRJ files for the Borland IDE (Interactive Development
Environment).  These control files are both vendor-specific and
version-specific.  The .PRJ files assume that your Borland compiler
is installed in the C:\BORLANDC directory.  If this is not the case,
you will have to change the settings using the Option menu, with the
Directory command.  The programs that you need to compile with Watcom
have batch files that look something like xxxx___C.BAT.  These are used
to compile specific files with the Watcom compiler.

For Borland, you can also compile the programs using the DOS
command-line interface. Consult your Borland manual for details.
Remember that the files have to be compiled using the Large model.


GENERAL NOTES:

You must invoke the batch file RUNME1ST.BAT by typing RUNME1ST before using
the software found in this book.  The batch file sets certin environment
variables that are essential for the proper operation of the software.
(for example, without running the batch, if you run one of the PROC programs,
take TREES for example, you will find that it writes two lines at the top
of any piped file it generates-no good).  The batch also sets up the BOB
environment variables and path to allow the software to run from any
directory, an to allow BOB access to all .B, .BO and other files that it
requires for rendering.

TEST.BAT is a batch file used to quickly preview a rendering, before you
spend the time rendering a full, nice image.  Use it by typing:

  TEST <<.b_filename>>

Note that some of the software found in this book may not be compatible
with your graphics hardware.  Refer to your hardware manuals and to the
graphics card manufacturers for help.  Our drivers handle many cards, but
not all graphics cards.
