Starting Ed
-----------

Getting Ed running is very simple. Simply type ed <enter> at the 
DOS prompt (making sure, of course, that you are either in the 
same sub-directory as ed.exe, or that the appropriate sub-
directory is in your path). There are no command line parameters 
or switches. No muss, no fuss. 

NOTE: As implemented, Ed uses the 1024 x 768, 256 color mode of 
the SVGA driver. If your system does not support this mode, then 
you must modify and re-compile the source code for Ed. A file 
named EDRES.DOC is included with the source code for Ed, and 
documents the changes necessary to use other display resolutions. 


Ed's Screen
-----------

Ed partitions the display screen into three areas. The largest 
partition, which starts in the upper left corner, is the Object 
Display Area. When you load or modify scene and object files, a 
wireframe view of the database under construction is presented 
here. Objects or portions of them are highlighted when they are 
edited. 

To the right of the Object Display is the System Status Area. 
Important information such as the file currently being 
manipulated, the eyepoint position and look angle coordinates, 
system mode, etc. is displayed here. In addition, a small 
Cartesian coordinate axis is displayed which shows the 
orientation of the world X,Y,Z axes within the current view. 
This helps you keep your sense of orientation when manipulating 
objects or moving about in a large scene space. 

Finally, the lower portion of the screen is the User Dialog Area. 
When Ed requires additional information, such as the name of the 
object file you wish to load, a prompt will appear here. User 
responses and error messages are also displayed here. 


System Modes
------------

Ed has several modes of operation, depending upon what commands 
have been previously issued or are in process. Ed starts up in 
Scene mode, which allows you to move the eyepoint position, add 
or delete existing objects. 

Object mode is entered to modify existing objects or create new 
ones. Vertex mode is a subset of Object mode for creating and 
modifying polygon vertex lists. 

Studio mode is active when modifying the studio parameters and 
when adding, deleting, or modifying lights. 


Telling Ed What To Do
---------------------

All user input to Ed comes from the keyboard. Ed's commands are 
single alphabetic characters, and are not case sensitive. The 
escape <Esc> key aborts most operations. The arrow keys 
manipulate eyepoint and object position when the system is in 
Scene mode. 


System Parameters
-----------------

Ed displays the values for a number of system parameters in the 
System Status Area: 

Eyepoint Linear Delta - Change in X, Y, or Z position of eyepoint 
per keystroke 

Eyepoint Angular Delta - Change in Yaw, Pitch, or Roll of eyepoint 
position per keystroke. Specified in degrees. 

Object Linear Delta - Change in X, Y, or Z position of object per 
keystroke 

Object Angular Delta - Change in Yaw, Pitch, or Roll of object 
position per keystroke. Specified in degrees. 

Object Scale Delta - Scaling factor per keystroke.
Current Eyepoint Position - Current X, Y, Z of eyepoint.

Current Eyepoint Look Angle - Current Yaw, Pitch, and Roll of 
Eyepoint. Specified in degrees. 

To modify the system parameters, press 'P'. Ed lists the system 
parameters in the Dialog Area, along with the current value and a 
prompt for you to enter another value. For example: 

               Eyepoint Linear Delta  [10.0] :
               Eyepoint Angular Delta [1.0] :

pressing <Enter> at each prompt retains the previous value. 
Otherwise you type in the new value followed by <Enter>. 


Reading and Writing Scene Files
-------------------------------

To read an existing scene file into Ed, press the 'R' key while 
in Scene mode. Ed then asks for the file name, and . For 
complex scenes this load process can take some time, so be 
patient with Ed. 

To write the current state of your scene file, press 'W'. Ed 
asks you to accept the current file name or specify another, then 
writes the . Along the way Ed checks to see if there are objects 
which have not been saved, and asks what to do with those it 
finds (i.e., save or not). 


Exiting Ed
----------

Leave if you must by pressing 'Q'. Ed is so stunned by your 
desire to depart that you'll be asked if you're sure. If there 
is no hope of salvaging a once beautiful relationship, Ed 
(gentleman to the end) will drop you off at the command line from 
whence you came. 

NOTE: Ed manipulates the PC's graphics adapter (obvious) and uses 
dynamic memory allocation (not obvious) during operation. If Ed 
is terminated rudely (i.e., via <ctrl>-C or <ctrl>-break) your 
machine may be left hurt and confused. If Ed does totally lose 
it, we strongly suggest you re-boot the system rather than use 
other means of ejecting. 


Moving the Eyepoint
-------------------

Eyepoint movement is controlled by the arrow keys for left, 
right, up, and down motion. Movement along the world space X 
axis (in/out of the screen) is controlled by the '+' and '-' keys 
('+' to move in). In addition, the eyepoint look angle is 
controlled by combining the <ctrl> key with the desired 
directional key (e.g., <ctrl>-up pitches the eyepoint look angle 
up). 


Selecting Objects
-----------------

Objects are selected by pressing the tab key in Scene mode until 
the desired object is highlighted. 


Instancing and Deleting Objects
-------------------------------

Previously defined objects (a .BO file already exists) can be 
instanced into the current scene by pressing the 'I' key while in 
Scene mode. Ed asks for the filename of the object via a prompt 
in the Dialog Area, then loads the object from the file and shows 
it with default placement and scale factor in the Display Area. 

To remove the highlighted object instance from the scene, press 
the 'D' key. 


Editing the object Placement and Scale
--------------------------------------

Changing an object's placement within the scene is performed 
using the arrow keys to "drag" the object from its current 
location to another, or using the <ctrl>-arrow keys to change the 
objects orientation (i.e., rotate the object). When the object 
has been moved to its new desired position, press the <Enter> key 
to exit placement editing. To scale an object up, use the '<' 
key. To scale it down, use '>'. 


Changing the Studio
-------------------

Ed makes the task of creating and modifying lights and the studio 
definition easy by using templates which prompt you for the 
necessary parameters. To enter Studio mode, press 'S'. Ed then 
places small spheres in the Display Area that correspond to each 
light in the scene. One of these lights will be highlighted, and 
therefore selected for modifying. To select other lights, use 
the tab key. 


Adding and Deleting Lights
--------------------------

To add a light to the scene, press the 'A' key. Ed then asks you 
to identify which type of light to add, and what the values for 
the light parameters are. To delete a light use the tab key 
until the desired one is highlighted. Then press the 'D' key. 
Hey! Who turned out the light? 


Modifying Lights
----------------

Once you have selected the light to modify, press 'M'. Ed lists 
the parameters for the light in the Dialog Area, along with the 
current value and a prompt for you to enter another value. For 
example, if you had selected a point light, Ed would display 
something like: 

       falloff [4500.0]       :
       center X       [500.0] :

pressing <Enter> at each prompt retains the previous value. 
Otherwise you type in the new value followed by <Enter>. 


Editing Studio Parameters
-------------------------

To edit the studio parameters, press 'S' again. Ed lists the 
parameters and their current values, allowing you to change them 
as desired. 


Leaving Studio Mode
-------------------

When you have completed making changes to the studio, press 
<enter>. Ed asks if you want to overwrite the existing scene 
file, create a new one, or abandon the edit. Make your choice 
and you are returned to Scene mode. 


Editing Objects
---------------

Once an object is selected, Object mode is entered to modify the 
object. Two types of parameters within an object can be edited: 
the object's constructive geometry (its physical dimensions), 
and its characteristics (color, texture, etc.). Press the 'O' 
key to enter Object mode. 

NOTE: Ed "flattens" the database hierarchy when it loads objects. 
That is, if an object file itself contains other objects, the 
hierarchical relationship of these two objects is lost, and Ed 
treats them as two objects of the same level. This necessitates 
care when editing objects. In general, apply the rule that if 
you have modified an object, save it to a new file name when you 
have finished. 


Editing Object Construction
---------------------------

Altering the construction of an object is accomplished through 
the combined use of the Display and Dialog areas. Ed provides 
three functions for construction editing: adding primitives, 
deleting primitives, and modifying existing primitive parameters. 


Adding Primitives
-----------------

To select this function, press the 'A' key. Ed then asks you to 
identify which type of primitive to add, and what the values for 
the primitive parameters are. 


Deleting Primitives
-------------------

Use the tab key to move through the primitives until the desired 
one is highlighted. Then press the 'D' key. Poof! That 
primitive goes to the great ray-tracer in the sky. 


Modifying Primitives
--------------------

Use the tab key to move through the primitives until the desired 
one is highlighted. Then press the 'M' key. Ed lists the 
parameters for that primitive in the Dialog Area, along with the 
current value and a prompt for you to enter another value. For 
example, if you had selected a circle primitive for change, Ed 
would display something like: 


       radius [150.5] :
       center X       [0.0]          :

pressing <Enter> at each prompt retains the previous value. 
Otherwise you type in the new value followed by <Enter>. After 
all the parameters for the primitive have been reviewed or 
modified, then the results of the change are displayed in the 
Display Area. Pressing <Enter> after this completes the modify 
function. 


A Special Case for Polygons
---------------------------

Polygons may have a variable number of vertices. If you want to 
delete or add vertices to a polygon, press the 'V' key once a 
polygon primitive has been selected. This places Ed in Vertex 
mode, and will interpret the 'A'/'D' key to mean add/delete 
vertex rather than add/delete primitive. Exit vertex mode by 
pressing <Enter>. 

NOTE: Ed does NOT perform a convexity check or other means of 
verifying that polygon primitives are valid. It is the user's 
responsibility to make sure that the vertices create a convex, 
planar surface. 


Editing Object Characteristics
------------------------------

Pressing 'C' in Object mode intices Ed to display the current 
characteristics of the object, and provide the ability to alter 
them. Ed lists the characteristics for the object in the Dialog 
Area, along with the current value and a prompt for you to enter 
another value. For example, if you had selected a circle 
primitive for change, Ed would display something like: 


       radius [150.5] :
       center X       [0.0]          :

pressing <Enter> at each prompt retains the previous value. 
Otherwise you type in the new value followed by <Enter>. 

NOTE: Ed does not support assigning characteristics to 
primitives, only to entire objects. This is because Ed does not 
save object characteristics within the .BO file, but places it in 
the .B file prior to including the object. Finally, Ed does not 
support bump or texture surface characteristics (adding this 
capability is left as an exercise for the reader, since we 
couldn't figure out how to do it). 


Leaving Object Mode
-------------------

When you have completed making changes to the selected object 
press <enter>. Ed asks if you want to overwrite the existing 
object file, create a new one, or abandon the edit. Choose 
wisely, and you are returned to Scene mode.
