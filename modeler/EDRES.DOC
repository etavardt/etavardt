EDRES.DOC
---------

This file describes the changes to make to ED's source code in order
to use different screen resolutions.

By default, ED has been coded assuming the use of a 1024 x 768 display
area.  ED uses the Borland BGI graphics functions, and as part of
the BGI invokes a driver called VGA256.BGI.

If your system graphics controller is either is not extended VGA 
ca[able or is not supported by this driver, you'll need to make some
changes and re-compile the source code.

I have SVGA, but the driver doesn't work
----------------------------------------
Just before ED goes into graphics mode, it writes a message to the
still text-based screen that indicates the graphics mode that the
driver is entering.  There are several modes available for this
driver, and there are several other drivers available in an
excellent shareware package of BGI drivers included with the 
BOB/ED package.  Please patronize Shareware!

Please refer to the documentation and header files which are in
this package, along with the docs from your graphics card
manufacturer.

Included in the driver package is a demonstration program called
(strangely) VGADEMO.EXE.  You can run this demo and specify
different driver types and resolutions to find out which ones
your controller supports.

If you still have trouble, call the technical support number for
the manufacturer of your graphics controller.


The driver is OK but I need to change ED for different resolution
-----------------------------------------------------------------

All of the screen resolution parameters are defined in the header
file EDMAIN.H.  Basically you specify what the total screen
resolution is, as well as the areas for object display, dialog
display, and text display.

Defines total resolution of screen:
   GC_CRT_XRES
   GC_CRT_YRES

Defines Display Area:
   
   Resolution:
      GC_VIEW_XRES
      GC_VIEW_YRES

   Placement:
      GC_VIEW_TOP
      GC_VIEW_LEFT
      GC_VIEW_BOTTOM
      GC_VIEW_RIGHT

Defines Status Area:
   
   Resolution:
      GC_STAT_XRES
      GC_STAT_YRES

   Placement:
      GC_STAT_TOP
      GC_STAT_LEFT
      GC_STAT_BOTTOM
      GC_STAT_RIGHT

Defines Dialog Area:
   
   Resolution:
      GC_MSG_XRES
      GC_MSG_YRES

   Placement:
      GC_MSG_TOP
      GC_MSG_LEFT
      GC_MSG_BOTTOM
      GC_MSG_RIGHT


You should define these areas with a little space between them through
which ED will draw the bars that separate them.


Your Color Choices are Lousy
----------------------------

Well, I took up Engineering because I failed at Art.  The Colors are
themselves defined in EDMAIN.H, so feel free to be as creative as you
dare.  Depending on your tastes, you may also wish to change the
type of palette that ED uses.  To do this, you'll need to change
the palette initialization in Initialize_Graphics() function
located in EDGRAPH.C to Init_Palette() or Init_Palette2().
